\title{Moments}	
\author{Edward Jex}
\maketitle
A moment is the product of each force and its distance from a fixed point, the pivot.

A rigid body is an object or body that is assumed to have a size and shape and not to be deformed when forces act upon it. 

Equilibrium is where the sum of all the moments is 0 as well as the sum of the forces so the motion is uniform. 

Levers can be used to lift heavy objects using a relativity small force, based on moments.
