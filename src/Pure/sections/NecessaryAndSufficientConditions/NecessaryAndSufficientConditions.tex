The symbol $\Rightarrow$ means implies. \\
It helps us to write arguments in a logical and step by step fashion.
We can write it in one of three ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A $\Rightarrow$ B	A implies B - A is a sufficient condition for B
	\item A $\Leftarrow$ B		B implies A - A is a necessary condition for B
	\item A $\iff$ B			A and B imply each other - Necessary and Sufficient.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Converse Statements}
The word converse is used to talk about a statement with the implication sign switched. 
For a triangle ABC: \\
Angle $ABC = 90\deg \Rightarrow AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$ \\ 
and \\
$AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \Rightarrow ABC = 90\deg$ \\ 

The converse isn't always true.
